    <h1>Alcohol outlets in Baltimore</h1>
    
    <p>For a reporting project, I've been looking at alcohol outlets in Baltimore.</p>
    
    <p>The city sent me their most recent "master list" of the businesses licensed to sell alcohol, including their name and address. <b>File: 240520_Baltimore_master.csv</b></p>
    
    <p>I geocoded the data, looked at values that didn't geocode propertly, and integrated cleaning code and ultimately some manual changes to get them all to generate latitude and longituded. THIS TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT! <b>Jupyter notebook: Baltimore alcohol cleaning and geocoding.</b></p>
    
    <p>Then with a big boost to start from TA Thomas, I identifed outlets with certain license-types (LA, LA2, WA) that are not allowed to be in residential areas, but appear to be thus located. <b>Jupyter notebook: identifying zoning</b>
    
      <img src="https://github.com/tedalcorn/Baltimorewebsite/blob/main/image.png" alt="A quick map of the non-confirming outlets">

    <p>I output a list of these irregular outlets to check with the city regulators. And I moved the data — first from Python to CSV, then to Geojson, then to Mapbox — into a map that shows the residentially zoned areas  <span style="color: lightgreen">(light green)</span>, all the alcohol outlets, those the Baltimore City government concedes are out of conformance with zoning law <span style="color: red">(red outline)</span>, and the couple dozen outlets that appear to be based on my analysis <span style="color: orange">(orange outline)</span>.</p>
